# SaliencyMapsXAIVA
Code repository for the 2022 seminar on Explainable AI by Visual Analytics at Hasso-Plattner-Institute for Digital Engineering.

This project aims to develop a visual analytics system which allows machine learning practitioners and domain experts to interactively monitor and influence the training process of deep neural networks (DNNs), more specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to solve classification problems. Motivated by current advances in generating precise visual explanations using different saliency map methods, this web-based system uses different gradient-based and activation based methods to produce visual explanations for images. This makes it more possible for humans to assess and interpret the prediction behavior and evolution of a model across the training phase. Additionally, this opens up a variety of ways for humans to intervene in to the training process such as early stopping, penalizing the loss for undesired behavior etc.
